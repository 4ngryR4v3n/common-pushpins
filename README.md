# common-pushpins
A Recon-ng module that will find common users that posted social media pushpins between locations.

Download the module into the directory for Recon-ng and reload the modules.  I put mine into a directory called custom but you can choose whatever name fits you best. After reloading the modules it will show as available to use.

/4ngryR4v3n/.recon-ng/modules/custom/common-pushpins.py

```sh
modules reload
modules load custom/common-pushpins
```
